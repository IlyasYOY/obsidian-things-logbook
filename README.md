# üìï Things Logbook for Obsidian

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) will periodically sync your [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) Logbook with your Obsidian Daily Notes.

## Why?

Anecdotally, I love using Things for task management. But I also want Obsidian daily notes to be a holistic view of my day-to-day. This plugin dumps completed tasks from Things into my daily notes, meaning I can keep my same workflow, and my Second Brain has a new data source.

## Usage

This plugin will fetches all your historical tasks and dumps them into the Daily Note corresponding to the **completed date** of the task.

It also displays any subtasks, tags, or areas associated to the tasks.

It will refetch the tasks at a designated interval.
